## Hi there 👋

I’m Yasamin Salimi, a soon-to-graduate PhD researcher specializing in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease with expertise in bioinformatics, data interoperability, and disease progression modeling. My passion lies in translating complex biomedical data into actionable insights through innovative analysis, machine learning (ML), and visualization tools.

### 🌟 About Me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working at Fraunhofer SCAI, focusing on data harmonization and interoperability for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease research.  
- 🌱 I’m always learning about the latest advancements in real-world data integration, artificial intelligence, and data interoperability frameworks.  
- 🤖 Passionate about applying ML and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve biomedical challenges and uncover disease mechanisms.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to patient-level data analysis, AI-powered data visualization, and semantic/statistical modeling in biomedical research.  
- 📚 I’ve trained multiple master’s students and taught classes in biomedical data science, disease modeling, and biological databases.  

### 💡 Ask Me About:
- Data harmonization and visualization in neurodegenerative diseases.  
- Cohort data analysis, especially related to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s research.  
- Using ML/AI for patient stratification, disease progression modeling, and real-world data integration.
