## Hi there 👋

I'm Yasamin Salimi, a bioinformatician with a passion for understanding complex diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. With a PhD in Bioinformatics, I specialize in data interoperability, cohort data analysis, and disease progression modeling. My work bridges biomedical data and meaningful insights using machine learning, semantic/statistical methods, and data visualization.

### 🌟 About Me:
- 🔭 I’m currently working at Fraunhofer SCAI, focusing on data harmonization and interoperability for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease research.  
- 🌱 I’m always learning about the latest advancements in real-world data integration, artificial intelligence, and data interoperability frameworks.  
- 🤖 Passionate about applying ML and artificial intelligence (AI) to solve biomedical challenges and uncover disease mechanisms.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to patient-level data analysis, AI-powered data visualization, and semantic/statistical modeling in biomedical research.  
- 📚 I’ve trained multiple master’s students and taught classes in biomedical data science, disease modeling, and biological databases.  

### 💡 Ask Me About:
- Data harmonization and visualization in neurodegenerative diseases.  
- Cohort data analysis, especially related to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s research.
